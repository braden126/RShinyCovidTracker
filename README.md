# RShinyCovidTracker

This Shiny App uses the ShinyDashboard package to create a dashboard for tracking Covid-19 cases in the United States. This dashboard is intended to provide a snapshot of the
reported Covid-19 cases for the current day. 

All data is gathered using the Rvest package to webscrape from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/ and is continuously updated.

The ui.R and server.R files are avaibable here as well as the standalone R script to scrape data from Worldometers, scrape.R

This application is hosted at https://braden-baker.shinyapps.io/covidtracker/?_ga=2.236753541.521348376.1596581135-1340566340.1587146122
